# Arm Model

This repository contains the MATLAB codes used to reproduce the results from the following publications:  
Ahmed, M.H.; N’Guessan, J.-E.; Das, R.; Leineweber, M.; Goyal, S. Simplified Cost Functions Meet Advanced Muscle Models to Streamline Muscle Force Estimation. BioMed 2024, 4, 350–365. https://doi.org/10.3390/biomed4030028

Organization is as follows:
1. Code: Has the arm mode code used to generate all the data plots corresponding to `Figures 2-7` in the manuscript
2. Data: Has the code and data for section `3.3 Model Validation` to reproduce the plots corresponding to `Figure 8`

## Instructions for running code
1. Download the zip file or clone this repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/mahmed271995/Arm-Model
```
2. Navigate to the `Code` folder
3. Open the file `Arm_Model.mlx` on MATLAB and click **Run** to execute the simulation
  * This will solve the system of equations, generate all required variables, and produce the plots corresponding to `Figures 2-7` in the manuscript
